# nosql-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. 

This project is to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help a food magazine's, Eat Safe, Love, journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

The project contains three parts:

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up - (NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge)
Part 2: Update the Database - (NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge)
Part 3: Exploratory Analysis - (NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge)

Specific questions from the magazine, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid, were answered in Part 3.
